#### I created this tool in order to empower people to make informed decisions when parking in Vancouver. In order to draw any real conclusions more studies with data I do not have need to be performed. For more information see the "Things to Note" section of the read.me

[Online heatmap can be found here](https://lazar.adamovic.org/vancouver-car-break-ins-heatmap/)
#### -It shows a heatmap of car break-ins in Vancouver in the previous 12 months
#### -The black dots are paid city-parking (parking spots owned and operated by the city). You can turn this off by going to the upper left corner of the dashboard and de-selecting the layer

## Things to Note:
#### This map can be a useful tool which tells the user where cars have been broken into, however, the data should be taken with a grain of salt. This map only shows the where the cars _where_ they were broken into, it doesn't show you where cars _were not_ broken into. I will go into detail about the not obvious  circumstances which may skew the data. 
#### Firstly, the map does not show you where people are likely to park their or how frequently cars park there. Cars could be more likely to be broken into in a specific area, simply because it is a popular spot to park. This is most likely true for the downtown region. This is something which I cannot account for, since I do not have that data. Therefore, I cannot draw any definite conclusions from the data.
#### Another issue is that I do not have access to data which describes the rules of parking for that specific street; resident parking, no-parking or temporary no-parking zones. Although the city may have data which describes these permanent and temporary no-parking restrictions, it is not open-access and I was unable to aquire the data.
#### In regard to resident-only street parking, some areas in Vancouver you can only park there if you are a resident of that street. However, if the residents of that street all have garages or driveways on their property, they will most likely use their garage/driveway, as not only is it easier, but it's also generally safer. Since the residents are not parking on that street and the public is not allowed to park on the street, the likelihood of a car break-in would decrease for that street on the heatmap, even though in reality the likelihood of car breaks-ins the same as the area around it. 
#### The second problem concerns the temporary no-parking zones. Certain streets are designated no-parking zones during rush hour traffic. Therefore, by design they are on average they are less likely to be parked on. Therefore, just like the previous example, they may appear safer on the map, but in real-life they are just as safe as the streets surrounding it.
#### The final issue is that certain streets could have been temporary no-parking zones for several months due to construction. This may skew the regular car break-in data, as well as the seasonal break-in data. 
#### Finally, although no definite conclusions can be drawn from the data, this map does provide some insight on the happenings of Vancouver, and it could be used to rationalize further study and research into this topic. I hope you found it useful and interesting.
